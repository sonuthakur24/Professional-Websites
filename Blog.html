        <p class="lead">A full stack web developer is a person who can develop both client and server software. In addition to mastering HTML and CSS, he/she also knows how to: Program a browser (like using JavaScript, jQuery, Angular, or Vue) Program a server (like using PHP, ASP, Python, or Node)
          A full-stack web developer can be defined by some as a developer or engineer who works with both the front and back ends of a website or application. This means they can lead platform builds that involve databases, user-facing websites, and working with clients during the planning phase of projects.
          The term “full stack” refers to the technologies and skills needed to complete a project, with each individual component being a stack. Stacks can be mobile, Web or software specific. Typically, a software engineer will focus on one part of development, either the front end or the back end.

            </span></h2>
        <p class="lead">A front-end developer builds the front-end portion of websites and web applications—that is, the part that users actually see and interact with. A front-end developer creates websites and applications using web languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allow users to access and interact with the site or app
          Below are some of the most important technical skills that you should learn if you plan to excel in front end development.
1., 2., 3. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. ...
DOM Manipulation. The Document Object Model (DOM) provides a programming interface for any document on the web. ...
AJAX. ...
Node. ...
MySQL. ...
React. ...
Java. ...
Problem-Solving.
The most extensively used Frontend Language is HTML, which is a markup language. HyperText Markup Language is the abbreviation for HyperText Markup Language. It's a programming language that is used to make websites and web apps.
It's complicated. The bulk of frontend work is a lot of work, but with minimal complexity or abstraction. There are a zillion things you need to know or learn, but it's possible for a typical competent developer to learn them. Even mediocre developers are typically capable of learning the basics.

        <p class="lead">The back- end of a website consists of a server, an application, and a database. A back-end developer builds and maintains the technology that powers those components which, together, enable the user-facing side of the website to even exist in the first place.
          Back-end development includes the server implementation and it more on the logical interaction of data, how it is stored, and transmitted. Back-end developers typically work with programming languages such as PHP, Python, Go, and new Javascript libraries like Node.
          This typically includes three major parts:
The server. This is the computer that receives requests.
The app. This is the application running on the server that listens for requests, retrieves information from the database, and sends a response.
The database. Databases are used to organize and persist data.
The boot camp for backend web development is difficult and it takes a while to learn. If you don't know anything about web development, then you're going to feel overwhelmed very quickly. It requires close attention to detail since one minor alteration can ruin the entire function of a website.
